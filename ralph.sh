# RALPH Loop Runner - Claude Code Edition (with Flight Recorder)

# Usage:
#   ./ralph.sh                               # Run (5 iterations default)
#   ./ralph.sh 10                            # Run 10 iterations
#   ./ralph.sh --model <m>                   # Run with model override
#   ./ralph.sh --postmortem-model <m>        # Different model for postmortem
#   ./ralph.sh --review-interval 3           # Run adversarial review every 3 iterations
#   ./ralph.sh --model <m> 10
#   RALPH_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514 ./ralph.sh
#   Postmortem runs automatically after the loop.
#
# Each iteration is a FRESH Claude context window.
# Progress lives in files + git + .ralph flight recorder logs.

## Context
- RUN_ID: $RUN_ID
- RUN_DIR: $RUN_DIR
- Iteration just completed: $iteration
- Commit range to review: ${LAST_REVIEW_COMMIT}..${current_commit}
- Review log to write: $review_log
- Prior review files (read these FIRST for cumulative context):
${prior_reviews:-  (none — this is the first review)}

## Instructions

1. **REQUIRED:** Load .claude/skills/ralph-output-adversarial-review.md and execute the FULL review protocol.
   This is NOT optional. Do not perform a lightweight review.

2. **Cumulative review protocol:**
   - Read ALL prior review files listed above
   - For each prior review's open issues: check if resolved in commits since that review
   - If resolved: note resolution with commit hash
   - If NOT resolved: carry forward as open issue in THIS review
   - If a prior review missed something you now see: add it as a NEW finding

3. **Full review areas (from skill):**
   - A) Checkbox Integrity — do changes satisfy Done-when criteria?
   - B) Testing Strategy Compliance — integration tests for I/O, screenshots for UI
   - C) Architecture Compliance — follow constraints from AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md
   - D) Framework compliance per CLAUDE.md
   - E) UI Sanity — error states, loading states, runtime errors
   - E2) UI Screenshot Gate — UI files must have L3+ with screenshots
   - F) Regression Risk — edge cases, N+1 queries, unsafe assumptions
   - G) Slopwatch — reward hacking patterns
   - H-K) Duplication, useless tests, L3 evidence audit, L3+ artifact verification

4. **Write findings to: $review_log** using the skill's deliverable format for mid-loop reviews.

5. **Write actionable items:**
   - NOW items: insert at top of IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
   - PARK items: append to BACKLOG_PARKING_LOT.md
   - Every finding MUST have a disposition (NOW, PARK, or FIX INLINE)

6. **Process improvement authority (additive only):**
   - If you identify a recurring pattern that should be a skill: create it in .claude/skills/
   - If you identify a gap in ralph-loop.md or testing-strategy.md: add the missing check/gate
   - You may ONLY add rules, never remove or weaken existing ones
   - You may NOT edit CLAUDE.md (constitution requires human approval)
   - Log all process edits under '## Process Improvements Applied' in the review file

7. **Verdict:**
   - Output 'VERDICT: FAIL' if hard fail criteria met (pauses the loop)
   - Output 'VERDICT: PARTIAL' if issues found but not blocking
   - Output 'VERDICT: PASS' if clean

## Run Metadata (MUST USE)
- RUN_ID: $RUN_ID
- RUN_DIR: $RUN_DIR
- ITERATION: $i
- ITER_LOG (write this file before commit): $ITER_LOG

## Bootstrap (Read these files FIRST)
1. AGENTS.md and/or CLAUDE.md - Constitution (authority, constraints, quality bar, routing)
2. PROJECT_CONTEXT.md - Current architecture and state (if present)
3. TOOLING.md - Available tools/services (if present)
4. $PLAN_FILE - Task breakdown

## Instructions (ONE TASK ONLY)

1) Find the next incomplete task in $PLAN_FILE:
   - Look for '### Task:' blocks with unchecked 'Done when:' items
   - Work on the FIRST incomplete task you find
   - A task is complete only when ALL its Done-when checkboxes are satisfied

2) Determine MODE from Task Routing in AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md (engineering/ux/marketing/ops/etc.)

3) Load relevant skills from .claude/skills/:
   - REQUIRED for code: testing-strategy.md (if present — integration vs unit; no fakes)
   - REQUIRED: ralph-loop.md (process discipline)
   - If UI impacted: ui-smoke-validation.md (or follow UI validation policy)
   - If schema/events touched: extend-only-design.md (if present)

4) BEFORE coding: choose Verification Level (L0-L4) and state why:
   - I/O coordination (DB/HTTP/actors/external) => L2+ (integration tests required)
   - UI or UI dependency changed => L3+ (UI smoke / Playwright required)

5) Implement to satisfy ALL unchecked Done-when criteria for the chosen task.

6) Verify (must match chosen level):
   - Minimum: build + test (language-appropriate commands)
   - If Level >= L3: run UI smoke/Playwright and check for console errors
   - Follow any additional quality gates from AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md

7) FLIGHT RECORDER (MANDATORY):
   - Write $ITER_LOG BEFORE committing.
   - Include:
     - Task selected (exact title)
     - Surface area classification
     - Verification level chosen + reason
     - Skills consulted
     - Commands run + outcomes
     - Deviations/skips + justification
     - Follow-ups noticed but deferred + why
   - If you claim a command was run, it must appear in the log with outcome.
   - 'Log or it didn't happen.'

8) If verification passes:
   - Commit to the current feature branch with a descriptive message
   - NEVER 'git add' the .ralph/ directory or any files inside it — flight recorder logs are local-only
   - Update $PLAN_FILE checkboxes in the SAME commit
   - Update TOOLING.md if you used or discovered a new tool/resource

9) Stop at checkpoints (UI approval, architecture decisions, credential setup) and ask the user if needed.

10) Exit - do NOT continue to additional tasks.

## Constraints (Constitution)
- ONE iteration = ONE task block
- Never commit to dev/main/master
- Follow constraints from AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md
- Test against real infrastructure (per testing-strategy)
